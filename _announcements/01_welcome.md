Welcome everyone!


We’re looking forward to meeting you all for our first class on Thursday, 1/12 at 5pm!

We’ll start with a brief discussion of course logistics, and then jump straight into learning the maths and the tools! :)


Please join our [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/32366) for all course discussions and announcements.


Minseung and John
