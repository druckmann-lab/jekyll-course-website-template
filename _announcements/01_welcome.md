Welcome everyone!


We’re looking forward to meeting you all for our first class on Thursday, 1/09 at 5pm in CCSR 4205!

We’ll start with a brief discussion of course logistics, and then start with programming basics. For the first lecture, please bring your laptop so that you can follow along with the exercises.
