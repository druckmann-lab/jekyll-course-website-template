Welcome everyone!


We’re looking forward to meeting you all for our first class on Thursday, 1/11 at 5pm in LKSC 308!

We’ll start with a brief discussion of course logistics, and then start with programming basics. For the first lecture, please bring your laptop so that you can follow along with the exercises.


Please join our [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/51930) for all course discussions and announcements.
